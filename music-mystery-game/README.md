## The Story

Ten years ago, the renowned composer Edmund Ashworth vanished from his family manor on the night he was to debut his masterpiece - a composition he called "The Silence Breaker."

Since that night, Ashworth Manor has been consumed by an unnatural stillness. No birds sing. No clocks tick. Even the wind holds its breath.

You are drawn to the manor by a cryptic letter. As you explore, you discover that the only way to solve the mystery - and break the oppressive silence - is to learn the language of music itself.

## What You'll Learn

Through gameplay, players learn:

### Intervals
The emotional vocabulary of music - from the tension of a minor 2nd to the triumph of a perfect 5th.

### Modes
The seven "colors" of music (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian) and how each creates a different emotional atmosphere.

### Chords
How notes combine to create harmony - major, minor, diminished, augmented, and seventh chords.

### Melody
The art of creating memorable musical phrases - contour, stepwise motion, leaps, repetition, and resolution.

- **Love (L)** - Melodic connection (intervals, melody)
- **Justice (J)** - Structural balance (modes, form)
- **Power (P)** - Rhythmic drive (tempo, dynamics)
- **Wisdom (W)** - Harmonic depth (chords, complexity)
