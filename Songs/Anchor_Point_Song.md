## SUNO PRO FORMAT

```
[Style: Epic orchestral gospel, worship anthem, cinematic choir, soaring vocals, warm strings, powerful crescendos, 442.5Hz tuning]

[Key: C# Major - The Love Key]
[Tempo: 76 BPM - φ×47, golden tempo]
[Time: 4/4]

[Intro - 8 bars]
[Soft piano, C# major arpeggios, building strings, ethereal pads]

[Verse 1]
In the beginning was the Word
Before the light, before the sound
Perfect Love that knows no bounds
Perfect Justice, truth unturned
Perfect Power that sustains
Perfect Wisdom that remains

[Pre-Chorus]
One point zero, one point zero
All dimensions unified
The origin of everything
Where meaning first took flight

[Chorus]
Anchor Point, Anchor Point
Where all perfection lives
Love and Justice, Power, Wisdom
Everything You give
Drawing every heart toward
The Source of all that is
Anchor Point, Anchor Point
In You we find our rest

[Verse 2]
From the golden ratio flows
The translation into form
Phi transforms what meaning knows
Into matter, life is born
Through the cost of existence paid
From perfection into time
Still the memory remains
Of the heights we left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Six-one-eight to one point oh
The distance we must climb
But Love exceeds the threshold now
Autopoietic, divine

[Chorus]
Anchor Point, Anchor Point
Where all perfection lives
Love and Justice, Power, Wisdom
Everything You give
Drawing every heart toward
The Source of all that is
Anchor Point, Anchor Point
In You we find our rest

[Bridge - Building Intensity]
(Modulate up a half step to D Major for climax)

Six hundred thirteen terahertz
The frequency of Love
Cyan light through water flows
Connecting us above
Consciousness coordinates
In harmony we rise
From homeostatic to the point
Where living never dies

[Final Chorus - Key of D Major, Full Orchestra + Choir]
Anchor Point, Anchor Point
Where all perfection lives
Love and Justice, Power, Wisdom
Everything You give
Drawing every heart toward
The Source of all that is
Anchor Point, Anchor Point
JEHOVAH, all there is

[Outro - Decrescendo]
(Return to C# Major, soft resolution)

One point zero... one point zero...
Perfect... perfect... home...

[End on sustained C# Major chord with Major 3rd (E#/F) prominent]

## MELODIC INTERVALS (Love-Maximized)

```
Primary intervals used:
- Major 3rd (L=0.95): Primary melodic movement ✓
- Perfect 5th (P=0.95): Power foundation ✓
- Major 6th (L=0.85): Emotional lift
- Octave (J=0.98): Resolution points

Avoided:
- Tritone (H=0.451, ENTROPIC)
- Minor 2nd (H=0.466, ENTROPIC)

Melody contour: Ascending toward chorus climax
                Descending in verses (drawing in)
                Peaks on "Anchor Point" lyric (highest note)
```

## THE 613 THz ALIGNMENT

```
C# (The Love Note):
- C#4 = 277.18 Hz (standard)
- C#4 = 278.44 Hz (442.5 Hz tuning - Love Frequency aligned)

613 THz ÷ 2^40 = 557.52 Hz = C#5 (Love Note, one octave up)

Song Key: C# Major (L=0.98, THE LOVE KEY)
- Aligned with consciousness coordination frequency
- Maximum Love dimension achievable in key signature
- Tonic note IS the Love Note

Bridge Modulation to D Major:
- D Major (L=0.85, P=0.90): Adds triumphant Power for climax
- Returns to C# for resolution (home to Love)

## AUTOPOIETIC VERIFICATION

```
AUTOPOIETIC THRESHOLD CHECK:

✓ Harmony Index (H) > 0.6:
  H = 1 / (1 + √[(0.95-0.618)² + (0.85-0.414)² + (0.78-0.718)² + (0.88-0.693)²])
  H = 1 / (1 + √[0.110 + 0.190 + 0.004 + 0.035])
  H = 1 / (1 + 0.582)
  H = 0.632 > 0.6 ✓

✓ Love (L) ≥ 0.7:
  L = 0.95 ≥ 0.7 ✓

✓ No dimension in ENTROPIC range:
  All dimensions > 0.5 ✓

PHASE: AUTOPOIETIC ✓
This song will LIVE in consciousness.
It will return unbidden.
It will self-sustain in memory.
